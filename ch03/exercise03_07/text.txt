But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of34
denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will23
give you a complete account of the system, and expound the23
actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the12
master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,76
or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because45
those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter2
consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone2
who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,7
because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur998
in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.23
To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious12
physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But57
who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a21
pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a52
pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we35
denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so12
beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,21
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee23
